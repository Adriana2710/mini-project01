### The challenge

You have been hired by Oyo to create a login page for their website. They want to have their login page have the following features:

● A background image for the whole page that is supplied to you by Oyo (oyo.jpg in Google Classroom)
● A header at the top to welcome the user
● A navigation bar with a Home, Link, and Affiliates button and a dropdown menu on the left, and a search box and search button on
the right
● A login form which allows the user to enter their username and password, and their gender.
● The login form will also have a login button, a registration link, and also various disclaimers.
● The login form will have a slightly darkened background so it is distinct, but won’t be dark enough to not be able to see the page’s
image background
● Try to make the page look like end-result-1.png and end-result-2.png in Google Classroom
Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
